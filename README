# sniff

Youtube to album system

input files are `*.album` and `*.albums`
	- `*.album` is a toml file with no sections
	- `*.albums` is a toml file
depends on `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp`

builds a folder containing metadata and the needed files
filemetadata will need to be updated manually.

Generated album folders will have a `.album` file for updating

A temporary `.sniff` file is used.


## notes 
the `.sniff` directory is not yet implemented. Don't expect any structure to be there

yt-dlp is provided `--print after_move:filepath` to get where the file is downloadedto
this is because we let yt-dlp choose the download format
